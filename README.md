# Steam Discovery Auto Refresh

This Greasemonkey script will automatically refresh the main page of [Steam Discovery Queue](https://store.steampowered.com/explore/). This is especially convenient if you empty your Discovery Queue for the day, and then encounter an update bug which would require that you click several times on refresh and continue.

This script can be used in conjunction with [Steam Auto Queue](https://github.com/woctezuma/Steam-Auto-Queue/tree/timer).
